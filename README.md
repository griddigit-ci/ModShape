# ModShape (Model Shape) - A Python & SHACL based Model Validation

## General
This [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) based model validator is an open source Python application. Main contributors are [gridDigIt Kft.](https://www.griddigit.eu/) and [Associmates GmbH](http://www.associmates.eu/). The code is Licensed under the Mozilla Public Licence (MPL) v2.
The application is based on [RDFLib](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib) and [pySHACL](https://github.com/RDFLib/pySHACL).

It supports activities related to the validation of the RDF-based datasets such as IEC CGMES (Common Grid Model Exchange Standard).

## Features
The current version of the code supports limited use cases and will be enhanced in Q1/Q2 of 2024. The development team is open to participate in collaborative projects.

In order to perform validation you need to have the datatype mapping as RDF construct (produced by [CimPal](https://github.com/griddigit/CimPal)), the dataset that is to be validated and the constraints (SHACL shapes)

SHACL based constraints for CGMES v3 ([IEC 61970-600-1:2021](https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/63866) and [IEC 61970-600-2:2021](https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/63867)) are provided as part of the application profiles published by [ENTSO-E](https://www.entsoe.eu/) [CGMES CAS application profiles](https://www.entsoe.eu/Documents/CIM_documents/Grid_Model_CIM/IEC61970-600-2_CGMES_3_0_1_ApplicationProfiles.zip)
SHACL based constraints for CGMES v2.4 (the withdrawn [IEC TS 61970-600-1:2017](https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/27556) and [IEC TS 61970-600-2:2017](https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/32923)) are not available in [ENTSO-E](https://www.entsoe.eu/). SHACL constraints that are autogenerated by [CimPal](https://github.com/griddigit/CimPal) are included in this repository. An incomplete version of SHACL constraints to validate constraints defined in the ENTSO-E QoCDC document v3.2.1 and v3.3 are also provided in this repository.
