# SHACL Validator

## General
This SHACL validator is an open source Python application. Main contributors are [gridDigIt Kft.](https://www.griddigit.eu/) and [Associmates GmbH](http://www.associmates.eu/). The code is Licensed under the Mozilla Public Licence (MPL) v2.
The application is based on RDFLib and pySHACL.

It supports activities related to the validation of the RDF-based datasets such as IEC CGMES (Common Grid Model Exchange Standard).

## Features
The current version of the code supports limited use cases and will be enhanced in Q1/Q2 of 2024. The development team is open to participate in collaborative projects.

In order to perform validation you need to have the datatype mapping as RDF construct (produced by CimPal), the dataset that is to be validated and the constraints (SHACL shapes)

SHACl based constraints for CGMES v3 (IEC 61970-600-1:2021 and IEC 61970-600-2:2021) are provided as part of the application profiles published by ENTSO-E [CGMES CAS application profiles](https://www.entsoe.eu/Documents/CIM_documents/Grid_Model_CIM/IEC61970-600-2_CGMES_3_0_1_ApplicationProfiles.zip)
SHACL based constraints for CGMES v2.4 (the withdrawn IEC TS 61970-600-1:2017 and IEC TS 61970-600-2:2017) are not available in ENTSO-E. SHACL constraints that are autogenerated by CimPal are included in this repository. An incomplete version of SHACL constraints to validate constraints defined in the ENTSO-E QoCDC document v3.2.1 and v3.3 are also provided in this repository.
